#9/15/25 Week-long leak test

On Monday, 9/8, collected 3 samples of roof air 1h apart and held them for a week. On 9/15, removed the samples to measure them. 
Cans 1 and 3, which were at 40.36 and 40.39 psig respectively, maintained their pressures when measured by an analog gauge, but can 2 went down to 31 psi for some reason.

Turning the autosampler on its side to leak-check valve connections did not show any major leaks (at least when checked with Swagelock snoop fluid?). 
However, the source of the large leak after turning off the pump was identified to be the pump itself, as capping the inlet resulted in a significant increase in the time it took for the system to go down from 40 psig, and I felt it with my hand too.
After capping the pump, the leak rate went down to 0.1 psig every 5ish seconds, with the 4 suspect valves (the one whose can failed the leak test and the 3 new ones) open and capped.
Closing these valves resulted in an even faster leak rate of 0.1 psig/3 seconds, which indicates that the majority of the leak is probably within the manifold, and not past one of its valves.
